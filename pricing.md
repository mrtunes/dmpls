<b>Basic Website</b> <br />

A basic webpage package is identical to what you see on this current site, except with your company or project's information. We set everything up for you, and all you have to do is help us create the content by answering some questions about what you do. <br /><br />

<b>This includes:</b><br />
• Four pages - Home, More Info, Pricing and Sign Up <br />
• Copywriting service to help optimize the info about your business for the web<br />
• Hosting for life. You read that right, and it's only limited to the first batch of members. <br />
• Simple logo design. If you don't already have a logo, we'll help make a simple one for you to get you started. 
 <br /><br />

 <b>This <i>does not</i> include:</b><br/> 
 • Images - You can submit one image per page, but we have intentionally designed these sites to be light on imagary unless where absolutely needed.  <br />
 • Domain names - such as mysite.com. You can purchase this from any domain provider, and we'll help point it to your Dimple. <br />  <br />

<span class="orange">To set up the <b>basic website</b>, we have 10 slots available at the price of <b>$50 CDN</b></span>. <br /><br /> Why so affordable? This introductory pricing is in place to make sure we're doing the best job possible before rolling it out to new members. 
<br /><br />
