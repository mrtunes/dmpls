<b>Basic Website</b> <br />

A basic webpage package is identical to what you see on this current site, except with your company or project's information. We set everything up for you, and all you have to do is help us create the content by answering some questions about what you do. <br /><br />

<b>This includes:</b><br />
<span class="f5">• **Four pages** - Home, More Info, Pricing and Sign Up <br />
• **Copywriting service**  to help optimize the info about your business for the web<br />
• **Hosting for life** - You read that right, and it's only limited to the first batch of members. <br />
• **Simple logo design** - If you don't already have a logo, we'll help make a simple one for you to get you started. 
 <br /><br />
</span>

 <b>This <i>does not</i> include:</b><br/> 
 <span class="f5">• **Images** - You can submit one image per page, but we have intentionally designed these sites to be light on imagary unless where absolutely needed. This is because if not done well, images can be distracting, and stock photos often look phony. Better to keep it simple, dimple. <br />
 • **A control panel** - If you are looking for a DIY service, this is not for you. To make updates to your site, all you have to do is start an email or chat thread with us and we'll take care of it for you. <br />
 • **Domain names** - such as mysite.com. You can purchase this from any domain provider, and we'll help point it to your Dimple. <br />  <br />
</span>

<span class="orange">To set up the <b>basic website</b>, we have 10 slots available at the price of <b>$50 CDN</b></span>. <br /><br /> Why so affordable? This introductory pricing is in place to make sure we're doing the best job possible before rolling it out to new members. 
<br /><br />
