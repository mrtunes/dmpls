When wafting through dozens of stinky options for making a website, we came up with a list of things that are important to us. <br /><br />

They are: 

A quick explanation of who you are and what you do. Which is on the homepage. 
Contact information on every page - this is most handy for your existing customers. 
Email lists and the ability to sign people up to something useful. 
Fast loading times**: This is not only helpful for the user, but for search engines to find you. 
No cumbersome menus**: After locating your password on a dirty napkin from last year, you are rewarded with an endless amount of tabs and menus to sift through. 
A clean and simple layout**: On most Do-It-Yourself website platforms, you can spend days if not weeks sifting through a variety of useless templates. 

So today, we are proposing something different. We build a clean and simple website for you, just like the one you're on right now. 

We'll help you write the copy, and you'll have a way to track its effectiveness by seeing how many people make it to page two (which you're on right now). 

To make changes to the website, you purchase tokens which can help you do things like create new pages or turn on your email list.

The basic setup is free, and if you're happy with the results you can pay what you want. The site will live at dimplist.com/mysite. To set a custom domain (such as mysite.com), you have to purchase tokens.
