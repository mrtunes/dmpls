When wafting through dozens of stinky options for making a website, we came up with a list of things that are important to us. <br /><br /> <b>They are:</b> <br />

• **Fast loading times**: This is not only helpful for the user, but for search engines to find you. <br />
• **No cumbersome menus**: After locating your password on a dirty napkin from last year, you are rewarded with an endless amount of tabs and menus to sift through. <br />
• **A clean and simple layout**: On most Do-It-Yourself website platforms, you can spend days if not weeks sifting through a variety of useless templates.  <br />
• **One goal**: While it's tempting to stuff the entire kitchen sink into your site, it's a fruitless endeavor. If you want your visitors to book a free evaluation, or buy your product, indentify the one goal and stick with it.
<br /><br />

<b>How it Works </b> <br />

We ask you a few questions over email to get the basic website setup to your liking. After that, to make changes to the website, you purchase tokens which can help you do things like create new pages or turn on your email list.

<br/> <br />

You can purchase any domain, and we'll help you connect it to your Dimple.
